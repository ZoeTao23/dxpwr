\title{Sample Size Calculator for Diagnostic Tests}
\usage{
adjust_for_cluster_data(n1_unadj, avg_obs_per_patient, intra_corr, R = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1_unadj}{(integer): Number of required patients with condition if each patient had only one observation.}

\item{avg_obs_per_patient}{(numeric): Average number of observations per patient.}

\item{intra_corr}{(numeric): Average correlation between test results of observations from the same patient.}

\item{R}{(numeric): Ratio of patients with and without the condition (default: 1).}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{adjust_by_cluster} containing:
\itemize{
\item method (character) - Adjustment method.
\item parameter (list) - Input parameters containing:
\itemize{
\item correlation (numeric): Average correlation between test results of observations from the same patient.
\item avg_observations (numeric): Average number of observations per patient.
\item R (numeric): Ratio of patients with and without the condition.
}
\item sample (list) - Output results containing:
\itemize{
\item n_with_condition (integer) - Unadjusted number of patients with the condition.
\item n_without_condition (integer) - Unadjusted number of patients without the condition.
\item n_unadjusted (integer) - Total unadjusted sample size.
\item n_with_condition (integer) - The anticipated sample size for patients with condition in studies with clustered data.
\item n_without_condition (integer) - The anticipated sample size for patients without condition in studies with clustered data.
\item n_adjusted (integer) - The anticipated total sample size in studies with clustered data.
}
\item call (character) - The original function call.
}
